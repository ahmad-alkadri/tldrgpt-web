## Notes
This app uses OpenAI's GPT API for generating summaries. You will need to have an OpenAI API key to use this app. Please refer to the OpenAI documentation for more information on obtaining an API key.

Once you've obtained the API key, go to `your-local-path` folder
where you've cloned this repo, create a `.env` file and put the following line in it:

```
OPENAIAPI=<your-openai-api-key-here>
```

Once launched, the app will read your `.env` file and load your
OpenAI's API key into it.

The quality and accuracy of the generated summaries may vary depending on the input article and the chosen profile. The app is designed to provide a general summary and may not capture all the nuances or details of the original content.

This app is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for critical or sensitive applications.
